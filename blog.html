                        <h4>Question Number 01: <br>
                            What is the difference between LocalStorage & SessionStorage </h4>
                        <h6>Answer:</h6>
                        <p>
                            sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in
                            localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.
                            The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do with lifetime and scope:
                            how long the data is saved for and who the data is accessible to. Session storage is
                            destroyed once the user closes the browser whereas, Local storage stores data with no
                            expiration date.

                            What is the difference between Global Scope Vs. Block Scope</h4>
                        <h6>Answer:</h6>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript ES6 has different ways to declare and use variables.In javascript the whole
                            document is global scope and all the other functions and variables are contained in this
                            global scope.
                            A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops,
                            are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables
                            declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope.
